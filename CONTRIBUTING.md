## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for one repository in the [prestodb](https://github.com/prestodb) organization, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, the communitybridge-easycla bot will notify you if you haven't signed, and will provide you with a link.  If you are contributing on behalf of a company, you might want to let the person with manages your corporate CLA whitelist know they will be receiving a request from you.
